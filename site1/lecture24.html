<p id="p1"> I just bought a Villa in Madhapur. I am looking furniture manufacturer who can provide Modular furniture for entire with good quality and pricing. I researched a lot online and short listed three companies CustomFurnish, Triad Interio and Home Lane. Any suggestions for Best among them?</p>
	<p id="p2">I have visited almost all the furniture stores in Hyderabad/Mumbai/Bangalore. These guys are best in cheating people with ease. This is a FAKE company. Their representative priyanka will speak nicely with you and see will take cheque. Once you pay them they will stop lifting youâ€™re calls and their designs are very old and even a road side furniture guy can do it. Their office is located in dusty and slum area and you have to call 10 times to reach there.</p>
